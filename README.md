# Overview
This aims to securely manage, streamline and perfrom data pipeline on the structured and semi- structured Youtube videos data based on the Covid 19 United states Datasets


# Project Goals
Data Ingestion — Build a mechanism to ingest data from different sources (Structured and Unstructured) ETL System — We are getting data in raw format, transforming this data into the proper format Data lake — We will be getting data from multiple sources so we need centralized repo to store them Scalability — As the size of our data increases, we need to make sure our system scales with it Cloud — We can’t process vast amounts of data on our local computer so we need to use the cloud, in this case, we will use AWS Reporting — Build a dashboard to get answers to the question we asked earlier

# Services we will be using
Amazon S3: Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides manufacturing scalability, data availability, security, and performance. 
AWS IAM: This is nothing but identity and access management which enables us to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
AWS Glue: A serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development. AWS Lambda: Lambda is a computing service that allows programmers to run code without creating or managing servers. 
AWS Athena: Athena is an interactive query service for S3 in which there is no need to load data it stays in S3
